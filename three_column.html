                    <h2>The Mark L (Three Column Layout)<a class="go_up" href="#" class="up">&uparrow;</a></h2>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p align="justify">The Mark L (Mark 50) is Tony Starkâ€™s fiftieth Iron Man suit. It was built after the Mark XLVII. Mark XLVIII Hulkbuster Mark 2 whilst Mark XLIX is Rescue armor Mark 1 (confirmed by hot toys figure and other merchandise).

The Mark L has been used to battle Thanos and his allies. This armor is more advanced than any other previous armors, the entire armor is stored inside the detachable Arc reactor on Tony's Chest, it possesses many capabilities and useful functions for Tony to use at his disposal.

Like the Marks XLV, XLVI, and XLVII, this armor has the F.R.I.D.A.Y OS built into it and possesses some of the most advanced technology and weapons compared to other armors Tony Stark has built.

The Mark L can materialize nano booster wings for a boost in speed and stabilized flight when needed or when armor's palm repulsors cannot provide stabilization. It also has the capability to shoot nanotech from the launchers mounted in the left and right arm which can be used to deploy external structures, that can be used to repair or build. Tony uses this system to stop Thanos from closing his fist to use the Infinity Stones, as well as sealing the stab wound in his abdomen when Thanos stabs him. The Mark L has a different design compared to the Mark XLVII, featuring more red, yellow, and a hint of silver.</br> It also includes the F.R.I.D.A.Y. OS like the Mark XLV, XLVI, and XLVII armors. The armor is much sleeker and more fluid than the previous armors, and there is less segmentation in the suit overall. This is most likely because of the Suit's unique nanotech generation system, where covering the same surface multiple times would be inefficient and unnecessary. The suit also has 16 micro-RTs (bigger and not as numerous as previous designs) throughout the surface providing additional power besides the main Arc reactor or when the main reactor is damaged. While inactive the armor can act as clothing for the operator paired to the Heads-Up Display (HUD) glasses with F.R.I.D.A.Y. support if needed with a voice control function. The armor does not rely on exoskeleton unlike previous designs, instead when forming the suit forms a muscle layer which acts as strength enhancer, which is then covered by exo-structure and armor plating. This armor features advanced Nano - technology which helps in forming new structures and shapes of weapons in the suit. The Armor's composition consists Gold-Titanium nano - particles. The entire armor is stored within a new removable Arc Reactor which also serves as a storing unit for the Nano - particles (mentioned by Stark himself), and can be deployed when needed.</br> Despite the fact that the suit is composed of billions of nano-particles, the suit possesses incredible durability, power and flexibility never seen in any of the other previous Iron Man armors. Mark L can be completely disintegrated and re-shaped whenever the wearer desires thanks to its advanced Nano - technology. Tony usually uses this technology to remove the helmet for comfortable vision. Another example of this is when he was fighting Thanos on Titan, and he regrouped nano - particles from his leg to his arm to form a new hand repulsor. Despite F.R.I.D.A.Y OS disconnected from the Suit when Tony left the Earth's stratosphere due to the lack of internet connection, he was able to normally operate the suit's various functions. The Neurological control interface when formed allows Tony operate the suit and form modules without F.R.I.D.A.Y. assistance. Super Strength: The armor amplifies the user's base strength and combat skills to extreme levels.This was demonstrated when Iron Man was fighting Cull Obsidian, as well as during the showdown with Thanos on the planet Titan. The suit proved to be the one of two weapons able to make the Mad Titan bleed. The standard weapons on all Iron Man suits. These repulsors are way more powerful than the older suits.</p>
