                    <p align="justify">The Mark VII (Mark 7), is a Fully Loaded Rapid Deployment Suit, and was the seventh suit created by Tony Stark, to surpass the Mark VI, sometime between the events of Iron Man 2 and The Avengers.

It was featured in The Avengers movie, and made its debut in the movie when Tony was forced to order J.A.R.V.I.S., to get it ready for combat, despite it still being constructed, to use it in the upcoming battle with the Chitauri Army, as the Mark VI was heavily damaged from its last use by Tony during the events in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.

The suit was built for heavy combat, and was heavily armed with weapons.

The armor has a unique feature that involves forming itself into a large pod, and when opened, had mechanical arms, that could extend and reach onto Tony's arms, grabbing them and quickly wrapping itself around him. This was done through the use of two special metallic bracelets, both of which had encrypted codes embedded within them in the black rectangular spaces. The laser scanners on the mechanical arms scan these to confirm the user's identity and activate the pod.</br> The armor then forms itself around Tony. The Mark VII has shown itself capable of enduring a flight through the center of a Chiatauri Leviathan, protecting its occupant for a short time in deep space, and taking countless blasts from assorted Chiatauri energy weapons. The Mark VII is a bulkier suit with much more space for weapons. Its chest piece is circular like most other armors, unlike the triangular chest piece of the Mark VI.

The armor possessed air brake flaps, which reduced speed from 600 mph to 0 mph in seconds. It's the first Iron Man suit to ever have thrusters on its back which enabled Tony to freely use the repulsors on its hands in air combat. Mark VII is the first suit to have integrated arc reactor allowing Tony to develop new systems never seen on previous Iron Man suits. This suit uses advanced technologies based on the Mark V suitcase armor, which makes it far easier to put on. When activated by J.A.R.V.I.S. it takes flight and flexibly opens itself to allow Tony to enter the suit and automatically wraps itself around him, anywhere at any time, without the aid of any external mechanics.</p>
