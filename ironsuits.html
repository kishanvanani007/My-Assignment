                        <p align="justify">You may be wondering why I just established that the Mark L is Stark in his absolute prime but falls short of the mark VII? The Mark L and the Mark VII make the top 2 because you never feel like Stark puts himself on the line to face death in the face, other than when he dawns these armors.</p> 
						<p align="justify">The Mark L faces Thanos and loses, the Mark VII faces a portal leading to a massive alien army and wins. Yes, it is slightly unfair to make this comparison because the two scenarios are very different. However, the Mark VII is still the only armor to have the title of almost single-handedly preventing large-scale destruction. New York needs the Avengers together to face Loki’s army, but only Iron Man is needed when a nuke is about to wipe out the entire coast.</p>

                        <p align="justify">How can anyone disagree with this being one of the most powerful and visually appealing Iron Man suits to ever grace the screen? This has been confirmed to be the 50th Stark armor, leading us to believe that the unseen Mark XLVIII (the only suit to still be unaccounted for) was its prototype.</p>
                        <p align="justify">The nanotech led to so many awesome enhancements and abilities, but that is not the only reason why the Mark L ranks number 2. The suit takes visual inspiration from the recent comic Model Prime armor and can do everything and anything that previous suits could not. The armor’s capabilities make it the most far-fetched Stark invention, but somehow the final result does not feel completely unbelievable on-screen.</p>

                        <p align="justify">In the past, Iron Man bested aliens, killer robots, genetically enhanced assassins, the Hulk and even held his ground against Thor. The biggest loss he took was at the hands of his own friend, Captain America.</p>
                        <p align="justify">One reason we can continue to debate and raise these questions about the climactic fight rests with the Mark XLVI. The 46th armor takes visual inspiration from the fan favorite Bleeding Edge suit from the comics. The distinctive small arc reactors all over the body blend the colors in a new shimmer, making previous suits feel out of style. Finally, it is time to say hello to retractable helmets for multiple piece helmets are an inconvenience of the past. That is exactly the point of the Mark XLVI, to feel like the most superior design capable of even stopping he who leads the Earth’s mightiest heroes.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Regardless of how you feel about Age of Ultron, you cannot deny that the Hulkbuster showdown was worth the price of admission alone. Fans anticipated the Hulkbuster fight, and boy did Age of Ultron deliver.</p>
                        <p align="justify">The Hulkbuster ranks in as the 44th Iron Man armor and is created by Stark and Banner in the event that Banner ever completely loses control of the Hulk. It is deployed and aided by an orbital tracking satellite, nicknamed “Veronica”, that can provide on-site enhancements when needed. Director Joss Whedon named it as a reference to the famous Archie Comics characters Betty and Veronica. Get it? Banner used to date a Betty and now Veronica is the last one available that can calm him down.</p>
